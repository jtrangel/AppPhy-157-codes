# AppPhy-157-codes
Undergrad 3rd yr 2nd sem

This semester the outputs were divided into three main parts (A,B,C) which had a focus on different topics per part:

* A - Complex systems
* B - Image processing
* C - Data Science

## 157A

* Report 1 -  Monte carlo simulations and random walks. Interesting phenomena such as Brownian motion was also observed
* Report 2 - Cellular automata and agent based modelling (Sugarscape model)
* Report 3 - Networks (Graph topology, Nodes, Edges) along with applications such as network density, clustering, node importance and relationships.

## 157B

Consists of 2 `.ipynb` files, which covered results and data for three reports on image processing techniques in python

### 157B1

Covered the creation of 3d shapes, apertures, graphs, and visualizing their 2d and 3d outputs. Includes also image processing (greyscale upscaling, RGB image filter algorithms, etc.)

### 157B2

Use of Fourier transforms for simulating diffraction patterns, image convolution, and feature matching. Mainly covers the use of the Fast Fourier Transform which is extensively optimized via matrix decomposition and removal of redundant calculations.

## 157C (Modules 1 to 3)

### Module 1

Demonstrates how to use cross-validation to avoid overfitting in a regression model. Uses the common modelling practice of splitting data set into training, cross-validation, and test sets. From here wte fit a polynomial regression model to the training set for different polynomial degrees. We can then compare how the model does for each polynomial degree of fit. This is done using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values.

### Module 2
